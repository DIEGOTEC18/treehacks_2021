let word = 'Gay A gay man is one who is romantically, sexually and/or emotionally attracted to men. The word gay can be used to refer generally to lesbian, gay and bisexual people but many women prefer to be called lesbian. Most gay people donâ€™t like to be referred to as homosexual because of the negative historical associations with the word and because the word gay better reflects their identity. \nBisexual A bisexual person is someone who is romantically, sexually and/or emotionally attracted to people of genders both the same and different to their own.\nTransgender or Trans : Transgender an umbrella term used to describe people whose gender identity (internal feeling of being male, female or non-binary) and/or gender expression, differs from the gender they were assigned at birth. Not everyone whose appearance or behaviour is gender-atypical will identify as a transgender person.\n';
