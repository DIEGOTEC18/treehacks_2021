# Treehack 2021

## Stanford University Treehack 2021

TreeHacks 2021 will be the 7th-ever iteration of TreeHacks. The theme this year is hacking for the future: addressing deeply impactful problems and building creative, unique solutions. It's identified five global and technological challenges that we think have tons of potential for innovation. Across each of these challenges, weâ€™ve scaffolded resources like potential project ideas, data sets, APIs and toolkits, and more to help get you get started.
