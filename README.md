# Treehacks 2021 : Reform the Norm

## Stanford University Treehacks 2021

TreeHacks 2021 will be the 7th-ever iteration of TreeHacks. The theme this year is hacking for the future: addressing deeply impactful problems and building creative, unique solutions. It's identified five global and technological challenges that we think have tons of potential for innovation. Across each of these challenges, we’ve scaffolded resources like potential project ideas, data sets, APIs and toolkits, and more to help get you get started. 

## Our Main Idea

Today, we live in times of rapid social change while also having unparalleled access to information and its subsequent dissemination. However modern political interaction is characterized by strong partisanship and a general lack of interest in information sharing and agreement across party lines.

## Problems

**1) Data breach by social media giants leading to censorship and suppression of voices**

**2) Trauma survivors have difficulty navigating through triggering information**

**3) Creation of Echo-Chambers**

**4) No tangible Impact**

## Inspiration

We're living in times with unparalleled access to information and its subsequent dissemination, hence vastly increasing the potential for rapid social change.

However, modern political interaction is characterized by a general lack of interest in information sharing across varying viewpoints as well as the indulgence in performative allyship leading to no tangible impact. Additionally, social media is wildly notorious for its unethical use of data and algorithms to censor or suppress certain voices while promoting content which they can profit off of. Activism in countries witnessing a rise in polarised governments has also been met with strict action being taken against the ones who dare question the status quo.

With Reform the Norm we advocate to break the norm and then reform it, one step at a time and we do so by incentivizing civic engagement on our decentralized open-for-all platform.

## What it does

Reform the Norm, built on the Ethereum Blockchain provides a decentralized platform for our users to Educate, Listen, Share and Act; covering social movements across issues and across countries.

1) Decentralizing the network gives people back their power by ensuring that there is no censorship or partiality towards a certain kind of content and the user information remains safe from any kind of breach.

2) We provide incentives to our users who actively raise their voices and contribute to the betterment of society by rewarding them with RTN tokens (ERC-20). Protocol followed ~

- 100 RTNs awarded to the user on registering
- 5 RTNs awarded to the user for creating a post and 1 additional RTN awarded per issue tackled in the post
- Users can "tip" other users' posts and the creator of the post would be awarded 2 RTN per tip
- Users can "share" other users' posts and both the creator and the sharer would be awarded 1 RTN each

3) Users are given the provision of adding trigger warning tags for posts that have a high number of trigger words. We do so to forewarn other users who might have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or other anxiety disorders and would prefer to avoid specific content that might trigger intense physiological and psychological symptoms.

4) Lastly users can specify which issues their post tackles and exactly where in the world is it affecting people. We sort information by "Specific Issues" and "Places" and provide links to our users that would allow them to learn more about the topic, play their part, and donate so that tangible impact occurs along with just social awareness and change.

## How we built it

We started off with designing the prototype with Figma, then built the front-end with HTML, CSS & Javascript. The RTN tokens were made using the ERC-20 standard in solidity. The decentralized back-end was built into the Ethereum Blockchain with Solidity smart contracts, image hosting in IPFS, and local development and testing with Truffle and Ganache. We used the Alchemy API for deploying to the Ropsten TestNet and transaction debugging, and Web3 for integrating our solidity smart contracts with the front-end. We used Python for the trigger warnings side and also implemented it in Javascript.

## Challenges we ran into

We had difficulty using the Alchemy API to integrate our smart contracts with our front-end since the documentation was a bit hard to understand.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Formulating a proof-of-concept for something like Reform the Norm that has the potential to bring about rapid, tangible change in society
Learning an entirely new technology, blockchain and figuring out a tech stack including new languages, frameworks and APIs for our project
Collaborating while working on three wildly different timezones and having wildly different backgrounds

## What we learned

We learnt the intricacies of the web 3.0 space and how the future needs to be decentralised in order for the world wide web to be an all-inclusive ethical space like it was initially meant to be. We also learnt about the Ethereum blockchain and the IPFS which when combined give us a fully decentralised web application. All of us wrote code in Solidity which is the language used to write Ethereum smart contracts for the very first time and read up about different kinds of standard tokens like the ERC-20 and ERC-721 and made our own cryptocurrency on the Ropsten TestNet!

## What's next for Reform The Norm

We intend to work a little more on:

- Optimising reach across varying viewpoints by applying graph algorithms on Ethereum nodes
- Integrating NLP into our smart contract to tag trigger words and issues correctly from the server-side
- Coming up with a more effective protocol for incentive provision
And finally, if all goes well we might release a whitepaper for an ICO (initial coin offering) for our cryptocurrency RTN and deploy our smart contract on the Ethereum MainNet.
