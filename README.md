# Treehacks 2021

## Stanford University Treehacks 2021

TreeHacks 2021 will be the 7th-ever iteration of TreeHacks. The theme this year is hacking for the future: addressing deeply impactful problems and building creative, unique solutions. It's identified five global and technological challenges that we think have tons of potential for innovation. Across each of these challenges, weâ€™ve scaffolded resources like potential project ideas, data sets, APIs and toolkits, and more to help get you get started. 

## Let us introduce our amazing team:

## Our Main Idea

Today, we live in times of rapid social change while also having unparalleled access to information and its subsequent dissemination. However modern political interaction is characterized by strong partisanship and a general lack of interest in information sharing and agreement across party lines.

## Problems

**1) Data breach by social media giants leading to censorship and suppression of voices**

**2) Trauma survivors have difficulty navigating through triggering information**

**3) Creation of Echo-Chambers**

**4) No tangible Impact**
